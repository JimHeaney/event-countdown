# Event Countdown

## Overview
I designed this circuit for my university's makerspace, to count down the days to Imagine RIT, the school's big event for students to show off their projects.

Using the screen and onboard buttons, you can set the current date and a target date. The system also has options for low-power modes, to turn off the lights at night. 

## Photos & Media
Photos of the project can be found on my portfolio, [here](https://www.jim-heaney.com/event-countdown.html).

## Current Release
Version 1.0

## Current State
The Event Countdown is on hold. There are a lot of issues I want to fix about it, but it is on the back burner for now.
